> The term **socket programming** refers to writing programs that execute across multiple computers in which the devices are all connected to each other using a network. There are two communication protocols that one can use for socket programming: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transfer Control Protocol (TCP).

> By definition, a socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on different computers on a network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the transport layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
